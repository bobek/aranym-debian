 2) What is this?
 ----------------

ARAnyM is a multiplatform virtual machine (a software layer, or an emulator)
for running Atari ST/TT/Falcon operating systems and applications on almost
any hardware with many host operating systems.
The reason for writing ARAnyM is to provide Atari power users with
faster and better machines. The ultimate goal is to create a new platform
where TOS/GEM applications could continue to live forever.

 Features:
 ---------
   o 68040 CPU (including MMU040)
   o 68040 and 68881/2 FPU
   o 14 MB ST-RAM and up to 3824 MB (configurable) of FastRAM
   o VIDEL, Blitter, MFP, SCC, ACIA, IKBD for highest possible compatibility
   o Sound (compatible with Atari Falcon DMA Sound)
   o Atari floppy DD/HD for connecting floppy image or real floppy drive
   o two IDE channels for connecting disk images, harddrives or CD-ROMs
   o extended keyboard and mouse support (including mouse wheel)
   o direct access to host file system via BetaDOS and MiNT xfs drivers
   o networking using ethernet emulation with a driver for MiNT-Net
   o TOS 4.04, EmuTOS, MagiC or Linux-m68k as the boot operating system
   o runs with FreeMiNT, MagiC, and any other operating system that runs
     also on real Atari computer.
   o Native CD-ROM access (under Linux, other OS: audio CD only), without
     scsi/ide/whatsoever emulation
   o USB and PCI NatFeat support for developing Atari drivers on ARAnyM

Important: ARAnyM is not finished. Consider this to be a beta version
and a work-in-progress. Sorry for incomplete and confusing documentation.
Any help with programming/documentation/porting is very welcome!


 3) Installing
 -------------

See INSTALL file and http://wiki.aranym.org/


 4) Configuring and running

 5) Keyboard shortcuts
 ---------------------

Keys not found on a PC keyboard:
--------------------------------

Atari Help key - mapped on the F11
Atari Undo key - mapped on the F12

Keys not found on Atari keyboard:
---------------------------------

Page Up key    - mapped as Shift+Arrow Up (usual combination in GEM apps)
Page Down key  - mapped as Shift+Arrow Down (usual combo in GEM apps)

Special keys (most can be re-defined in the SETUP):
-------------
Pause/Break    - invoke SETUP GUI (ARAnyM on-the-fly configuration)
Shift+Pause    - QUIT ARAnyM
Ctrl+Pause     - REBOOT ARAnyM
Alt+Pause      - enter integrated debugger (only if started with "-D")

PrintScreen    - create a screenshot in actual directory

Alt+Ctrl+Shift+Esc - release the keyboard/mouse input focus so you can use
                 your keyboard and mouse in other host applications.
                 Can be changed to other key combo in the Settings.
                 Middle mouse does the same job.

Scroll Lock    - switch between windowed and fullscreen mode


 10) Troubleshooting
 ------------------

If your Microsoft IntelliMouse doesn't work correctly on Linux framebuffer
console you may want to set the SDL_MOUSEDEV_IMPS2 environment variable to 1.

Example for bash: export SDL_MOUSEDEV_IMPS2=1; aranym
