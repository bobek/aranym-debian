hostfs.xfs
==========

The .xfs driver is now maintained in the FreeMiNT CVS repository.


hostfs.dos
==========

This is the MetaDOS driver that makes use of the NatFeat .XFS
interface. Basicaly it is the FreeMiNT file IO GEMDOS
implementation (FreeMiNT_CVS/sys/ dosfile.c dosdir.c)
mangled so that it compiles as a standalone binary.


Installation
------------
MetaDOS driver:
 * copy new hostfs.dos to your AUTO folder and add the entries
   into your bdconfig.sys, as follows:

   \AUTO\HOSTFS.DOS, E:E
   \AUTO\HOSTFS.DOS, F:F

   This example maps drives E: and F:.


BUGS
----
hostfs.dos
 - relocatable programs crash due to a serious bug in MetaDOS. Use BetaDOS
   instead (version 3.12+ might be available at
   http://www.ettnet.se/~dlanor/main/html/ra_files.htm).


Compilation
-----------
 * use make.sh to compile
 * the binary is placed into the bin subfolder
