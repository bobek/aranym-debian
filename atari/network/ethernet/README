aranym.xif
==========

The MiNT-Net xif driver for the ARAnyM ethernet interface.

Installation and usage
----------------------

 On host side (linux):
 ---------------------

Make sure the 'aratapif' (ARAnyM TAP IFconfig) binary is installed somewhere
in your $PATH (/usr/bin or /usr/local/bin) and that it is installed setuid
root. If it's not use the following commands (run them as root):

linux:~# chown root /usr/bin/aratapif
linux:~# chmod u+s /usr/bin/aratapif

Another important thing is to load the tuntap device driver (if it isn't
compiled in the host kernel). I load it with the following command:

linux:~# modprobe tun

And before loading this driver please check (and possibly fix) the 
read/write permissions of the "/dev/net/tun" device:

linux:~# chmod a+rw /net/dev/tun

Otherwise ARAnyM started by regular user could not access this device.

More information about TUN/TAP you'll find at http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/

 On Atari side:
 --------------

Install MiNT-Net and copy the aranym.xif into your mint folder.
Then configure the eth0 interface, best by calling the 'eth0-config.sh'
script.
If you wanted to configure the IP addresses or netmask, you could do that
in the ARAnyM config file.

Then in MiNT-Net you can e.g. ping to 192.168.0.1 (which is the default IP
of the TAP tunnel's host side).

How it works
------------

The ARAnyM establishes the TAP interface (using tuntap driver).

Compilation
-----------
 aranym.xif:
 * you need the source tree of FreeMiNT 1.16 (use
   CVS head branch) and if compiling on host, don't forget to edit
   freemint's CONFIGVARS and enable the CROSS=yes there. Point the
   FREEMINT_SRC_HOME environment variable to its home (the
   COPYING.MiNT file is there).
 * use make.sh to compile
 * the binaries are placed into the bin subfolder

 nfeth-config:
 * regular MiNT setup is able to compile it with simple 'make nfeth-config'

 ARAnyM itself:
 * run configure with --enable-ethernet
