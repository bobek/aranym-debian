These are the first basic tools for Aranym:

- CLOCKY.PRG that write actual mouse position to $f9000e/$f90010
  (It was faster to implement it into Clocky (TM) than to write a new TSR).
  Clocky by default do not alter the keyboard layout now. Get full
  Clocky 3.0 distribution at http://joy.atari.org/ - there's a nice editor
  of keyboard layout.

- PCPATCH.PRG that patches PureC (PC.PRG) to be able to compile
  projects and files from the BetaDOS driven filesystem.
