.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B aratapif
program.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.B aratapif
is used for setting up the network device in ARAnyM. It's basically stripped down version of standard ifconfig command that works on the TAP device only and so it's safe to setuid root.
